# Clock
This was made for the Computer Science Final Summative assignment. The project is to create a functioning gui for a clock I tried to build last year. The clock is comprised of a 2.1 inch round lcd display, 2 keyboard switches, a rotary encoder, a realtime clock module and a speaker. 

The Success criterion for the project are as follows
1. The ability to display the time given by the real time clock module
2. The ability to set multiple alarms which do not overlap each other
3. The ability to change settings in a screen
4. Functioning inputs
5. Working speaker
